# ReachBot-GUI
This is the ReachAIO Full rewrite. It also contains the brand new GUI made with electron. You can choose to build via source or download the already packaged versions. This version is full requests and a huge improvement. Enjoy!

# How To Use
Just like a regular application from the app store, you can download the .dmg file, open it and install it. Then you can casually open it from the applications tab like you would any app. Then enter your info and run the software. You first need to get a download though without the retracted source. Please DM me if you would like an already packaged download. There is no asar file or encryption, so you can see what is being run on your computer. 

# Main Page

This is the main page of the software, it allows you to enter your email, password, time, and queue up a task for the next reach. You can set any time, user, or password. You will get a popup once you start tasks. The popup will look somewhat like the starting tasks icon below.

# Monitor Page

This is the monitor page. If you see this page, that means that your tasks are queued up and will run when your selected timer hits zero. You can also press the stop button to end any tasks. There is no need to restart Reach every night. It will continue running at your selected time until told not to or closed.

# Starting Tasks Popup

This is the popup you will see when your tasks have successfully started. Once you see this, you should be redirected to the monitor page. You will also get a similar popup when starting tasks, then be redirected to the main page.
